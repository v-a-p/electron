## Welcome to team Electron's game documentation

We are working on a 2D survival game with resource gathering, combat, infinitely generated tile map with diverse biomes and a simple iniciating storyline.

The preset of the game and the main character's reasoning are that they, as a travaller, got shipwrecked on a new strange land, where they encounter creatures/inhabitants they'd never seen before. Are they the hero or the villain? Sometimes there's reason to believe in the gray area that is the human nature.
